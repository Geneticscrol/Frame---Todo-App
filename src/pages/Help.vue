    <p>Hi! I'm Saksham Sud the Creator, Founder and Manager for this app. This is a simple Todo App which I built using the QuasarFramework. The source code for this app is available on Github. Of Course, you can fork the project from there but on 2 conditions: 1)You have to put a link to this website or a text telling to download my app. 2)You have to put "I forked this project from Saksham Sud" on your main page.</p>
